# Mapping_Earthquakes
Module 13<br/> 


## Overview of Analysis:

After finishing an earthquake map containing 2 different maps and an earthquake overlay for Basil and Sadhana, we have been tasked to add more options.  We will be adding another map and 2 overlays.  The new overlays will contain the tectonic plates and the earthquakes with a magnitude of greater than 4.5.


## Resources:

Software: 
Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda 4.10.1, Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code 1.56.0

## Summary:

We have 3 different maps: Streets: Satellite, and Dark.

We have 3 overlays: Earthquakes, Tectonic Plates, and Major Earthquakes.
